# VIDEO GAME STORE
For this project I am creating a mock-up of an online video game store.

## Main plan:
 - Carousel with latest/popular games
 - Rows of games visible undernearth; different genres in different collections
 - Selected games will add their value to the shopping cart
 - Search function to filter and find your desired game
 - A checkout page where you can see which games you chose and the price sum

## Extra:
 - Creating a main game page that will show the selected game in more detail
 - Implement Atropos when hovering over game art on that game's main page
